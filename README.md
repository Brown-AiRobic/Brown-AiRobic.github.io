## Project details

This project is a web application that provides an overlay of historical redlining data on a map of the United States.
The front end of the application is built with React and uses the Mapbox library to display the map and overlay
data. The back end of the application handles requests for the redlining data from the front
end. In addition, users can search on specific keywords on the front end, which leads to a backend query.
This query returns all redlining data with that keyword in its area description, and highlights these areas
on the map.
