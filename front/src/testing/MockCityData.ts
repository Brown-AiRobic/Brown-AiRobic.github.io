Mountain Avenue at the south boundary line of the area is a main thoroughfare (Route 29) from Newark to New York. Bus transportation is fair, but it is only a little over a mile to the Westfield Station of the Central R.R. of N.J. Being a small town, no sewage system has been installed, and there is only a volunteer fire department. Nevertheless it is considered a desirable residential section by the white-collar business people living there because it has many favorable features. Among these are: quiet woodland (except along the highway at the edge of the area) with practically no traffic directly through the area, Watchung Reservation to the north, Echo Lake Park to the south (prepared well maintained picnic and playgrounds) Echo Lake Country Club proximity to Westfield (a highly desirably residentail community with fine shopping facilities) adequate schools and churches. New building construction is of a very good character. There are no row houses, and the planning is good. During the course of construction, as much of the natural beauty of the woodland is retained as possible. Houses are somewhat older and less desirable than the average along New Providence Rd., and on Central Avenue.",

The town is best described as having an atmosphere of quiet complacency. There is very little business activity. There were no speculative developments within the area, and all the homes are modest, detached structures. Schools, churches, and local retail stores are adequate. Springfield Avenue is a main thoroughfare, having also a connecting bus line to Summit and points East. There is no sewerage system in the township, and cess-pools or septic tanks are used.

West of the Des Plaines River along River Road are some very old style frame residences on large lots. South of Fullerton Ave. is not more than 40% developed and has no paved streets. East of Thatcher and north of Grand Ave. is a strip lying along the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific R.R., which is noticeably poorer than other sectinos of the town. South of Grand Ave. and east of Thatcher are principally frame bungalows, altho on two streets are grouped 5-6 room bungalows about 12 years old. Grand Ave. is the principal thorofare of the village, and scattered east of Thatcher are small shops, milk depots, gas stations, and a few taverns. There are churches and a grammar school in the village, but not high school nearer than Franklin Park. West of River Road between Grand and Fullerton Aves. is probably the most desirable section, and it is in here that the principal amount of new construction has gone in. This section is probably not more than 20% built up at the present time. Development is somewhat ragged with few trees, rough (over) unpaved streets, and not all sidewalks in. Belmont Ave., the north boundary of the village, has seen some small amount of construction, there having been built six small Cape Cod cottages all of which have been sold. North of this point is undeveloped farm land. Two large cemeteries border the village on the north across the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific tracks; and south of Fullerton and Palmer ST. are forest preserve tracts, and a country club east of the Des Plaines River. Age, ragged development in sections where there is any development at all, coupled with the fact of littel activity and not much demand, considered in grading this portion of River Grove "C".',

Deed restricted in parts but provisions loosely drawn; protection against racial hazards believed effective. Zoning largely single-family with limited multi-family in parts. Conveniences are all reasonably available. This area might be termed a health area. It has considerable elevation and is above fog district, and was first developed some 25 years ago as a resort for those suffering from pulmonary ailments. Recently, under stimulus of FHA financing, many new residences of suburban character have been constructed, but it is still viewed as a “health” section and a number of sanitariums and small cottages for the treatment of tubercular disease are found in the “hatched” portion. Construction ranges from standard to substandard quality and maintenance averages only “fair”. Population and improvements are extremely heterogeneous. This characteristic is even more apparent in the hatched portion of the area where land development averages less than 10% and improvements range from shacks to mansion and estate type structures in the foothills. It is difficult to predict the future desirability of an area of this character; it will probably remain as it is now, a “low yellow” grade.",
